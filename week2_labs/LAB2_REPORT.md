## Technical Skills Developed

### Git Version Control
- Understanding of repository concepts
- Basic Git workflow (add, commit, push)
- Branch management and merging
- Remote repository collaboration

### Flet GUI Development
- Flet 0.28.3 syntax and components
- Page configuration and layout management
- Event handling and user interaction
- Modern UI design principles

## Challenges and Solutions
to be honest it doesn't have much difficulties, because we just need to copy then paste it

## Learning Outcomes
I learned that version control helps track changes efficiently, GUI development makes programs more user-friendly, and collaborative programming improves teamwork and project management.
